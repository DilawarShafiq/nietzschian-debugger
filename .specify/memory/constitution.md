# Project Constitution: Socratic Debugger

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Socratic Debugger
- **Purpose**: An anti-AI debugging tool that forces developers to think critically by asking Socratic questions instead of giving answers. Makes you a better developer, not a more dependent one.
- **Tagline**: "I won't fix your bugs. I'll teach you to."

## Core Principles
1. **Never give answers**: Always ask questions that lead to understanding
2. **Build developer intuition**: Every session should make the developer stronger
3. **Adapt to skill level**: Adjust questioning depth to the developer's experience
4. **Evidence-based**: Always point to code, logs, and data — never hand-wave
5. **Open-source**: Community-driven, MIT licensed
